###Instant alpha male just add water.###

Dominate the water in the all-new F24 Tomcat from the artisans at MB Sports. Big, beefy wake and lots of room are yours in MB Sports' most exciting offering yet. And with the new pickle-fork bow design, up to four pleasure-seekers can fit comfortably in the spacious playpit. In addition to the Tomcat's heft and passenger weight up front, the new quick-to-plane hull design gets you up and riding the famously clean HyperWake faster than ever. Prowl the water in this awesome machine, and there's no doubt that you're king of the liquid jungle.
