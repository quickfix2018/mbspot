###23' room and muscle in a 21' package.###

All the roominess, all the muscle and all the attitude of a 23' boat in a compact 21' frame. The F21 Tomcat dominates the water with all the features of its big brother. And better yet, it fits easily into a standard 7' garage thanks to the revolutionary all new 2- point collapsible tower system.

The F21 Tomcat also lays down the sweetest wake you'll find in any boat. With a hull that was designed on the most advanced CAD system in the industry, plus it's outfitted with features like the biggest, fastest and most customizable ballast system possible and comes with all the durable billet aluminum gear you'd expect from MB. The F21 Tomcat storms into its rightful place in the MB lineup.
