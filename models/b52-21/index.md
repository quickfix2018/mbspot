### Open wide and say wow.###

MB Sports, the innovation company, has gone way over the top this time, or should we say “widened the gap”? The B52 21 has got enough room for the whole gang while it brings the famous MB wake that just gets better every year. This boat is equipped with up to 1,800lbs of the Quick Fill MB electronically-gated ballast system. The system is fully customizable for every style of rider and fills or empties in less than a minute.

With a 100” beam the B52 21 seats 14 comfortably and has more cockpit room than any other boat in its class. Plus, the wider stance gives more stability and precise handling that you are probably used to. You know MB would never re-engineer any of the B52 line without making a huge leap ahead, and that’s exactly what has happened here. Contact your MB Sports dealer and see for yourself.
